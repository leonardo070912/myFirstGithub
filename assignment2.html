<h1>Why i love being alone without friends. </h1>
<p> Being alone is always the best cause you are free to do  whatever you want, cause being to social can bring death , cause you dont know a true friend cause even your friend can give you something and still hate you it very common, not everything you tell someone. </p>
<p> There are reasons i love to stay alone: </p>
<ul>
<li> i love when everywhere is quiet</li>
<li> i hate people naturally</li>
<li> cause people are just too lousy</li>
</ul>

<h1>Doughnuts, the early years</h1>
<Hr>
<p>Hi. My name is Doughnut. I am a mighty
cat. I was adopted by my family when I was
only three weeks old.</p>
<p>My new mommy is an alien. They are simple
creatures. </p>
<p>I left the pound with my new mommy and
new sister, omo eru. They took me straight to
the pet store to buy:</p>
 
  <ul>
  <li>A kitty baby bottle and formula</li>
  <li>A small cloth toy</li>
  <li>Litter box with litter</li>
  <li>Food (for later)</li></ul>
  <p>Mom and sis had to feed me by bottle
because I was so young.</p>
