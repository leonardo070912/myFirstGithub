  <h1> Why i like to go swimming in the summer. </h1>
  <p> Swimming is the most favorite activity in the summer. When the sun is shining and the air is warm, you will find
    me dipping into my backyard pool. It's not an impressive pool, only three feet deep, but its mine. </p>
  <p>There are threee reasons i like to swim:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> I get lots of exercise</li>
    <li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
    <li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I left the pound with my new mommy and
    new sister, Maria. They took me straight to
    the pet store to buy:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A kitty baby bottle and formula</li>
    <li>A small cloth toy</li>
    <li>Litter box with litter</li>
    <li>Food (for later)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Mom and sis had to feed me by bottle
    because I was so young.</p>
